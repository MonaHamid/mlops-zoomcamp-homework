 MLOps Zoomcamp Homework 03 â€“ NYC Taxi Duration Model with Mage

This project trains a linear regression model to predict taxi trip durations using the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset for March 2023. All steps are performed inside Mage, and the final model is logged to MLflow.

 Question 1. Run Mage

Goal: Launch Mage using Docker Compose.

 Mage Version: v0.9.76

mage start <project_name>
