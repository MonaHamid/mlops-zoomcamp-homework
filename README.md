🧠 MLOps Zoomcamp 2025 – Fareeda Hamid
Welcome to my personal repository for the MLOps Zoomcamp 2025, a free and intensive 9-week course by DataTalks.Club that focuses on building scalable, production-grade machine learning systems.

📅 2025 Cohort
🗓️ Start Date: May 5, 2025
🎓 Status: Ongoing

📘 Course Overview
This course explores the complete ML lifecycle — from model training and experiment tracking to deployment, orchestration, and monitoring in production environments. Through hands-on projects, we use best-in-class tools to simulate real-world MLOps workflows and challenges.

You'll gain practical experience with tools like:

MLflow for experiment tracking

Prefect & Mage for orchestration

Docker & AWS Lambda for deployment

Prometheus, Grafana, & Evidently for monitoring

Terraform & GitHub Actions for infrastructure & CI/CD

🧾 Prerequisites
Before starting this course, learners are expected to have:
✅ Solid Python skills
✅ Understanding of Docker
✅ Familiarity with Bash / CLI
✅ Basic ML knowledge (e.g., completed ML Zoomcamp)
✅ 1+ year programming experience
