🧠 MLOps Zoomcamp 2025 – Fareeda Hamid

Welcome to my personal repository for the MLOps Zoomcamp 2025, a free and intensive 9-week course by DataTalks.Club that focuses on building scalable, production-grade machine learning systems.

📅 2025 Cohort
🗓️ Start Date: May 5, 2025
🎓 Status: Ongoing

📘 Course Overview
This course explores the complete ML lifecycle — from model training and experiment tracking to deployment, orchestration, and monitoring in production environments. Through hands-on projects, we use best-in-class tools to simulate real-world MLOps workflows and challenges.

You’ll gain practical experience with tools like:
MLflow for experiment tracking
Prefect & Mage for orchestration
Docker & AWS Lambda for deployment
Prometheus, Grafana, & Evidently for monitoring
Terraform & GitHub Actions for infrastructure & CI/CD
