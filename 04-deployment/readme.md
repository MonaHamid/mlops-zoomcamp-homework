Deployed a batch prediction pipeline for NYC Taxi duration prediction using Prefect Cloud. The pipeline:

Loads preprocessed taxi trip data

 Loads a serialized model (model.bin) and vectorizer

 Generates duration predictions using scikit-learn

 Saves predictions to a file with timestamp

Uses Prefect Cloud with a managed work pool, custom requirements.txt, and GitHub integration

 Debugged and resolved cloud execution issues including:

Module import failures

Missing dependency installation

File sync errors (e.g., model.bin, batch.py)

 Final deployment runs successfully on Prefect Cloud with automated scheduling options enabled
